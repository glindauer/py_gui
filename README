After installing git, you need to tell it who you are, and the email used to connect your account:
git config -global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config -global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

After that, to connect to an existing repository:
1) If you haven't made the local directory, make it, then enter
git init
to prepare it for connecting to a repository.
2) git remote add origin https://github.com/gittest1040/Hello-World.git

Now you are ready to 
git pull origin master (to pull the master copy at the origin branch?)
git add UPDATED_FILENAME ; git commit -m 'added_new_files'

The above locally updated the edited UPDATED_FILENAME (or added it if it is new). Now it is ready to be merged by others if they are connected to this local drive.

If, however, they are connecting to a remote repository, such as github.com, another step is needed: git push origin master, in order to update the repository; then the others would need to use git pull again to get it.
